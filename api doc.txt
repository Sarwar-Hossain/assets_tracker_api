Few words about project: As you mention in Bonus Point that many phone Companies can manage their enterprise 
subscribers. That means SAAS Software. SAAS Software Build based on Multi-tenancy concept. There are 4 Multi-tenancy concept. 
Which one shoud follow depends on requirements and situation. As this is small project so i follow - 
Shared Database, Shared Schema and Tenant ID: In this approach, all tenants share the same database and schema, 
but each record in the database includes a tenant ID. This allows the application to filter and query data 
by tenant ID to ensure that each tenant only sees their own data. So i followed this concept.
